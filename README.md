# racecar

A browser-based implementation of the old pixelated GBA game where you control a car and drive it in a race without crashing it with any other car 

I wish to make this a client side browser app which can be hosted using Github Pages. I intend to make it implement the original game as faithfully as possible, with the exception of there being color and more user-friendly interface.

The game will make use of the browser's keyboard event handling to implement responses to the left and right arrow keys, and also to the space bar (for pausing). The interface should be minimal and simple, and it is preferable that the entire game should be contained inside one HTML page.

The game will also use SVG elements to implement the graphics, and normal text-rendering as possible on a browser to display the game time, score and difficulty level. I prefer to use SVG for graphics since the shapes are HTML elements, and mouse-based events can be associated with them.

Since the game is a single static HTML page, there is no chance of vulnerabilities in the form of risk to availability, integrity and privacy.
